## Docker ##
**Docker** is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.
Docker is an operating system container management tool that allows us to easily manage and deploy applications by making it easy to package them within operating system containers.

**Docker containers are always portable......**

wow but how we can say this ? 

AAAhhhhhhhh we can build docker containers locally and deploy them to any docker environment(other computer, servers, cloud etc.). Now what you say isn't portable!

**Containers are lightweight** but how ?

Containers are sharing the host kernel (the host operating system) but can also handle the most complex applications
